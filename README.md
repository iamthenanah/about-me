# about-me

## 👋 Hi, I'm Nana

🎓 I'm a **Computer Engineering** student and a passionate **Frontend Developer** currently learning **Full-Stack Development**.  
💼 I’m also doing an **internship as a frontend developer**, working on real-world projects using **Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS**, and more.

🎨 I have a deep love for **design** in all its forms — from **digital interfaces** to **visual aesthetics** and **concept creation**. My interest in **UI/UX**, **visual design**, and **minimal, functional layouts** allows me to bring clarity and beauty to every product I work on.

💡 I love creating **clean, minimal, and user-friendly UIs**, and I care deeply about **order, performance, and responsiveness** in web applications.  
💪 I’m a determined and disciplined learner — whether it's mastering frontend frameworks or diving into backend development with **Node.js & Express**, I take the challenge!

🌱 Currently expanding my knowledge in:
- **Backend development (Node.js & Express)**
- **Database design**
- **API integration**

✨ I'm inspired by freedom, independence, and making smart, fast decisions.
